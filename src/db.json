          "title": "Can We Discuss WHAT THE FUCK Happened To VALERIAN and If its Redeemable Qualities Can Somehow Shine Through the Blunders that Reside at the Core of the Film?",
          "author": "e-vaughn",
          "markdown": "Like many that hold 'The Fifth Element' dearly in their hearts from their youth, I was pretty damn amped about Valerian. 2 of 4 of the trailers made it look like a decent enough lil adventure story, and the lushness of the visuals were enough to get my gears churning putting together all these little sci-fi concepts into *some* sort of sensible world-view. See, that’s what I absolutely LOVE about sci-fi as a genre and setting. It’s a straight-up playground for any creative visionary, and visuals/concepts alone can sometimes carry a sci-fi movie to great heights.\n\nThe Valerian trailers touched on a sense of excitement that *I remembered* the Fifth Element touching on. It looked fun, silly, and dramatic. There was a sense of rigidity in the lead actors that I did my best to dissuade myself from feeling. To be completely honest, neither of the two leads have done anything in any flick that I have actually really been impressed by. I wasn’t going to let a trailer get me to vilify what could be a solid flick. As reviews poured in around 70% on RT, I was actually pleasantly surprised… but then I started reading them and the numbers kept dipping over time. Still, I bit the bullet last night and watched Valerian: City of a Thousand Planets and hooollly shit, what happened?!?\n\n## Redeemable Qualities [Spoilers from here on out]\n\nI am stoked I saw this. Really happy to have seen it, actually, even though I think it was actually boring and hard to watch at times. I laughed during scenes I was supposed to laugh at, and found some of its thematic silliness to hit home well enough. I was legitimately amped on the introduction which showed diplomatic greetings over 150ish years and amongst an plethora of diverse alien species. My love of Sci-Fi and RPG style games (Mass Effects and KOTOR are great examples) really tuned my imagination when piecing together lore. Each alien race had enough detail and biological design that made my mind swirl: Ooh, how do these guys gather food? Is this a working class? Are these data-sentient only? How does his tentacle not wither outside his suit?![valerian Lorraine](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8GYxQAWkAEl5Co.jpg)”\n\nTHIS. This questioning and curiosity around concepts alone make this movie something worthwhile. “How does an alien exist that can reproduce nay material plugged into it? Why is this other alien race purely pacifistic?” These questions often came from the impeccable design the movie lavishly had on display. Honestly, the design and visual direction of the movie is easily its strongest shine. Spacecraft architecture, UI interfaces, weapon concepts, platforming tools, handheld interdimensional portals, and the clothing. Oh MY GOODNESS, the CLOTHING! The clothing and design of the fashion was extraordinary. Not only did the clothing look incredible, pull from various cultures, imply some practicality, it was all encompassing and really built the world up (especially in the intro scene). The clothing was beautiful and engrossing in a way that supported this movie’s value as pure eye candy, and it led to certain cerebral provocations.\n\nI had so many curiosities… but the more I thought about them, the more each concept and idea felt shallow and untethered to the universe crafted before us (Why the fuck does the Mul race need 20megaton energy pearls, and how come they aren’t utilized by ANY character in this movie?) and much less to any central narrative.\n\nI genuinely liked some Sci-Fi elements of this flick, but then there wasn’t any new concept that felt new and fresh and made me really think. I found much intrigue in the description of Alpha, with its neuron-building aliens, its underwater marine meanderers, and its finance-loving data-aliens. Sure, these bite-sized concepts got me enticed and many of them were gorgeous, but the sum of their parts add up to less than each one might have stood as a fascinating youtube video, or something.\n\nThis is entirely because the central narrative and driving force of the movie is about as off-kilter and uncharismatic as it gets.\n\n## Shit to Beef About\n\n![valerian shit](https://gifed.video/gif/001/pearl_alien_valerian_and_the_city_of_a_thousand_planets.gif)Fuck man, there’s a lot to beef about in this fucking flick. Since I’m on the narrative and the action and world-building, I’ll stay here for a second before moving to the elephant in the room. As I mentioned, Sci-Fi concepts have much less impact when they fail to actually drive the storyline forward and instead exist only to demonstrate some concept. Laureline’s entire expedition to the water-zone had her doing no actual heroics, save for sticking her head into a jellyfish butthole, AND that was done only to locate Valerian’s location. There are probably a thousand different side-quests that she could have done, and this movie chose this one. That’s fine, I guess, but it didn’t build her character in any capacity and there was a huge Checkov’s Gun blasted at our face when she stayed in the Jellyfish a second longer than was allowed yet there were ZERO repurcussions. Ok, fine. I guess we got a semi-inspired marine-life biology scene and got to look at Cara Delevingne stretch her ability to express fear and bewilderment, but this scene didn’t add to the whole in any way.\n\nThe action was *not* terrible. The melee combat with the dumb floppy aliens was actually pretty great, while the gun fight was horrendous. One of the best action bits of the trailer showcases Valerian running through multiple walls before exploding out into a chasm and then using a platform generator to traverse a gap, run through a neuron-harvesting field, and then propel underwater to arrive at a destination. Why does he do this? Is he being chased? Is he in trouble? Is it necessary? Well… no. He literally runs through those because it’s a shortcut. The best action scene has no gravity to it, at all.\n\nThe movie has no stock in our emotions at all, it would seem. It never creates tension, and I’d legitimately be surprised if anyone felt anything for these characters other than annoyance. And here we get to the crux of the problem: our two lead actors.\n\n## Acting, Charisma, and Screen Presence\n\nI didn’t expect the acting to be excellent based on the trailers, but I honestly didn’t expect this level of ineptness. It honestly is SO fascinating because of how much of a blunder this is. Like how the FUCK did you get actors that are this weak? Cara’s acting is relatively ok. She never wows, but she does her part has an occasional note of emotional expression that hits home. I liked her ending monologue about love, rule-breaking, and what she needs from commitment. It was directed at the wooden barn door that is Dane DeHaan, so it was effectively a monologue. Despite Cara’s best efforts, I was not inspired in any capacity, but I *can still* see why she was cast (those eyebrows, amirite?).\n\nI don’t want to sound incendiary, but I have no fucking idea why how Dehaan snagged this role. None. Like, what was Luc Besson going for with this? I really want to peep the source material comics to see if there’s some remnant of understanding it’ll denote as to why DeHaan was the most uncharismatic, phoned-in, annoyingly voiced, low-effort, semi-sarcastic, monotone leading man. There’s GOT to be some vision they were going for, right?\n\nThis fool had ZERO fucking screen presence. He had no energy, no chemistry with his lead (save for literally the final kiss which looked plausibly genuine), had no zest to his punchlines or jokes, and just behaved inconsistently as fuck between his “soldier” mentality and his grade-school attempt at playful banter. It was actually frustrating to endure. It made me realize just how important charm and energy matter in on-screen characters, and DeHaan’s depiction of this space-rogue/military agent/spy dude was probably the largest blemish of a leading man in an otherwise well-crafted movie I’ve seen in cinema. That seems hyperbolic, but fuck homies. **If you liked his acting, PLEASE let me know what you liked. I am genuinely curious what about his portrayal drew you to him, and how you related to him.** I feel like I could talk about the acting and how important it is have captivating characters that *can* be subdued or reserved yet still hold screen presence. Examples would be Gosling in Drive, or [Dan Steven’s in The Guest](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/2s6ozj/the_guest_and_the_cinematic_expression_of_human/).\n\nActing aside, the movie had no attempt at building Valerian as a character to give a shit about. So Valerian is a ladykiller…. That’s the only backstory we get? How? With THAT level of charm? It makes no sense. And Laureline makes fun of his lack of commitment, so his solution is to propose right then and there? How are these two into each other? And she’s *actually* pondering a life with him…. Why? He’s had about 40 other partners he brushed off, and then like, he’s inexplicably going to be faithful to Laureline for some reason? The fuck is this? And he’s a soldier says he “plays by the rules” yet is constantly shitting right where he eats and banging his partners? WHAT?! It’s a weird feeling when the most unrealistic thing about a sci-fi movie is the very human element and the only thing I can’t suspend my disbelief about.\n\nAnd it’s not like Luc Besson doesn’t understand good acting or how to NAIL this challenging tone of silly slapstick characters. You’ve seen The Fifth Element, right? If you haven’t go peep that immediately. I literally watched it right after Valerian to see how it stacked up. Korben Dallas, Leeloo, Zorg, and motherfuckin’ Ruby Rhod are DRIPPING with charm. They are all so over-the-top and adorable, flamboyant and energetic, emotive and they all have range. Korben’s sarcastic “fuck off with your bullshit” demeanor actually works and builds towards his character. In the first 2 minutes of him being on screen, we learn a TON about him. He’s an ex-marine, fucking up at his job, has mommy issues, has a bad smoking habit, and has amazing combat boots. I mean, Luc Besson directed these characters to success. It just makes the intention behind what happened with Valerian’s character make no sense at all.\n\n![valerian what happened](https://68.media.tumblr.com/388b275bed68efaf981e3d6061ce1b86/tumblr_ogfugmWi8T1tamedoo1_500.gif)What happened? What am I missing? Are people relating to DeHaan in this role? Is he embodying something to aspire to, in any capacity? Somebody, please, send help. Help me understand. Please.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nLuc Besson made the Fifth Element with fun characters and tonally enjoyable scenes of goofy sci-fi shlockiness. Valerian’s lack of fun characters illustrate how quickly a movie can crash right into the ground. Beyond some lush visuals and richness, beyond incredible aesthetic design and especially incredible costuming (this could win an Oscar just like Suicide Squad did), and beyond Ri-Ri’s solid cabaret performance, this flick ground to a halt with its uncharismatic lead. Hopefully others can explain what Valerian’s character was going for and how it worked for them.\n\n## RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n**Recommended for fans of this genre?** Yes. And only of this genre. This movie is for those that like hard sci-fi concepts and piecing together a lush universe and imagining better stories than what is currently on-screen. It’s for folks that care more about the aesthetic design and the way things might work than the characters.\n\n**Recommended for non-fans of this genre?** No. Honestly, no. I struggle to recommend this to anyone who would not like sci-fi because there is no emotional core to this film.\n\nSemi-arbitrary score: 2 out of 5 stars."

Through the roof.\n\nSound like the formula for the next sci-fi cult classic? If so, then you forgot the same vital ingredients the creators of Valerian did: a compelling storyline and an engaging cast.\n\n![valerian crash](https://media.tenor.com/images/2aba59f067b1c2f43337953efeb91cee/tenor.gif)While the film was wrought with intriguing futuristic concepts and beautiful design, its visuals weren't enough to make up for the poor acting and sub par writing. Both starring actors, Cara Delevingne and Dane DeHaan, gave underwhelming performances. They failed to bring any charisma to their characters, establishing no chemistry with the audience or each other. They are not solely responsible for the flat tone of the film, however. After all, the script gave them little to work with.\n\nWe first meet Major Valerian and Sergeant Lorelaine while they are enjoying a virtual beach. A playful, choreographed wrestling match ensues, sparking hope for a sexy sort of tension. Unfortunately, that was the epitome of chemistry, and the rest of the film lacks any hint of flirtation, arousal or even close friendship. Even when he proposes marriage, there is no sense of romance, love or excitement. In fact, the only catalyst for his proposition is to combat Lorelaine for calling out his fear of commitment. What a great foundation for marriage, saving face. The lack of emotion isn’t limited to the title character, however. This sense of apathy expands through the length of the film. I would argue that this is due to a complete absence of backstory.\n\nThe gaping deficit of context surrounding the characters inhibits the viewer from empathizing with them. The information hole was so distracting that I actually turned to my partner to ask if the movie was a sequel. It seemed as though the title character was intended to be a smooth, charming Casanova of sorts. His empty lines and blank history made it nearly impossible to frame him this way or even find him attractive hero. The heaviest collateral damage from this oversight came in the death of Rihanna’s character, Bubbles. Because our main character was so devoid of substance, his emotional response came across as cheesy. A moment that was inserted as a sentimental motif was just too little too late.\n\nWhile the incredible imagery that accompanied this empty plot wasn’t enough to save the film, it does have merit and deserves some mention. Particularly, I found the technology presented very intriguing. Early on, we see a huge empty park in the desert with hundreds of people wandering around. It is then revealed that they are immersed in some kind of virtual travel to another dimension via a VR like headset. Even more fantastic is that they can purchase items and then somehow transport them back to their reality. Strangely enough though, their purchases are nothing exciting and seem a poor choice on the writer’s part. If one of the few redeeming qualities of your film is it’s science fiction concepts, why not have them purchase futuristic gadgets? Instead, they are excited about the pile of junk they’ve acquired. What a wasted opportunity.\n\nThere is no denying that Valerian was both innovative and technically impressive. It was fun to watch for the imagery alone. However, this doesn’t keep the film from feeling less like a cohesive and immersive story, and more like a highlight reel of a writers' rooms best sci-fi ideas."

          "markdown": "When I first walked away from Valerian and the City of a Thousand planets, I felt relieved.  Based on a comic book series of the same name, this adaptation contains very little to keep the audience engaged beyond the sex appeal that comes with flashy animations, handsome actors, and tip top visual design and direction.  This appeal fades quickly as the narrative, and dialog are not very engaging.\n\nThe main actors themselves deliver lines that feel sophomoric and are lacking poise and expertise of professional special forces agents. Valerian exudes a boastful air as a major in some galactic law enforcement institution, and comes across as Johnny Bravo.  He mentions his epic love life and his sky high aptitude as a special agent, but he is always unprepared and by sheer luck and the actions of those around him, he is able to succeed.  The problem with this is that the emotional resonance I have with this character is that of a stoic idiot with an enormous ego, which rubbed me the wrong way constantly.  I felt for Laureline as she complains about his behavior and attitude, until she somehow falls even more in love with him by the credits.  The advent of this decision brought about by a moral conflict/resolution between the two characters which felt contrived immediately.\n\n![valerian aliens](http://cdn.movieweb.com/img.news.tops/NEoHmnwuKlNTsr_2_b/Valerian-City-Thousand-Planets-Character-Posters.jpg)I get that this is based on a comic, (which I have not read) and that for the most part the narrative of graphic novel can be allowed some leeway to showcase a more visually compelling experience, and in that sense this film is quite fun.  Character art and visual set pieces allow you to become lost and engrossed in the stories atmosphere and setting.  All of these aspects of the film are good, quite good, but there was a big gap for me in storytelling as Valerian and Laureline were just so one dimensional. I did not empathize with them and found myself wishing that they were replaced with different actors or received better direction or.. something.  Like watching two models blue steel their way through every and all situations, without a trail of breadcrumbs to connect the dots."

          "author": "e-vaughn",
          "markdown": "# The Action Landscape in 2017\n\nIt’s a great time to be an action movie cinaphile. While the 90s and early 2000s held their respective heads above water, the recent years’ entries have provided some interesting blends of incredibly well-choreographed action, solid editing, and stylistic cinematography. Moving away from the horrific shaky-cam, hyper-editing, sloppy action of the Bourne movies or Bond entries like Quantum of Solace, we find ourselves in a landscape with fresh action-flicks like The Raid 1 & 2, John Wick, and now Atomic Blonde.\n\nUnlike those other flicks which have a cemented identify in their action core, Atomic Blonde tries to be a bit more than a wonderfully well-crafted dynamo. Unfortunately, that ambition reveals several missteps that must be highlighted along with its successes.\n\n# Atomic Bombshells that Work\n\n![atomic blonde fight](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/07/atomic2/lead_960.jpg?1501211410)Atomic Blonde has much to be praised. I’ll get to the most exceptional component of its action in a little bit.\n\nIt’s got a stylistic tone and aesthetic that is reminiscent of its comic-book adaption roots. I love the soundtrack and 80’s vibe peppering the flick, while still maintaining a contemporary visual feel and cadence. The editing is fun and experimental early in the movie, but the latter half is strangely missing any editing gimmickery or flare.\n\nThe fashion is exceptional. Both Theron’s character and Macavoy’s are dripping with style and intentional clothing choices. There is a sexiness to the film and the color contrast is sharp throughout, without ever feeling too glossy or oversaturated. The movie is mostly cool hues that exaggerates the neon whenever it appears.\n\nAnd of course… the reason you likely watched the movie is the fighting and action. This is far from the first badass female protagonist we’ve seen leveraging physical combat to overcome her obstacles, but it might legitimately be the most well-constructed underdog fight scenes of any film in recent memory. The physicality of Theron’s performance, the style of martial arts she uses, the amount of brutal punishment she endures, the choice to contain abundant long takes and intimate hand-held camera footage… all of these make the action incredibly striking. Dripping with oomph, even.\n\nTo see a female combatant handle herself with such savagery is rare. To see a female fighter actually have grounded physics to her combat and deliver strikes and engagements that provide a realistic sense of momentum and weight is beyond rare. To see a female combatant clearly unable to outmaneuver a male opponent that has 100lbs on her is rare. To see a fighter that takes ridiculous punishment and showcase fight scenes where enemies visibly get winded and bleed out is rare. To have all of these massive action-focused positives embedded in a movie that tries to aim for more is also rare.\n\nThere are several note-worthy scenes to this flick. The hallway long-fight is exceptional. It’s an insanely long take (very likely interspersed with clever cuts when the camera hits flush against someone’s clothing or a wall, close-up) yet it moves dynamically and brutally. I can’t deny that I was in a state of awe for most of the fight scenes. Like John Wick’s palpable love of murdering goons, Theron’s character clearly enjoyed the physical struggle, which made me enjoy her struggle.\n\n# Atomic Elements that Fizzled\n\nWhile the intentional physical struggles were a sight to see, there were several components to this movie that prevent it from being a dazzling knockout.![atomic blonde action](http://cinemavine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/atomic-blonde-movie-charlize-theron-1-1.png)\n\nFirst and foremost, this movie is almost immediately comparable to John Wick in its style of action and combat (yet it very handily relies more on hand-to-hand combat, rather than gunplay). However, it isn’t a revenge thriller. It’s a spy flick. A spy flick that has a relatively weak plot, designed only to propel the story forward in search of a singular confidential “list” in the bowels of Berlin.\n\nThis plotting forces comparisons to much stronger spy-flicks like Mission Impossible, or character driven capers like the Bond franchise flicks. Unfortunately, the star player that is Theron’s character does not have the gravitas to hold down a spy-thriller. Her coldness makes her feel more like a Glacial Blonde rather than an Atomic one. I don’t recall a single moment where she is charming in her personality. There is never a moment where she actually uses disguises or persuasion, mental trickery, or anything that would normally be contained in an espionage picture. In fact, she’s so glamorous and beautiful that she sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nFor a movie that should and will very likely aim for a franchise streak, we’ll need to see more dynamic expression from our Atomic Blonde in order to preserve any notion of credibility that she’s actually good at being a spy… and not just a blood-thirsty combatant. Oddly enough, James Macavoy’s character lays on the eccentricity and spy-skills throughout, so the movie does have a notion that these elements are somewhat important.\n\nIt’s a bit funny that the most realistic parts of the film are the physics-based fight scenes, yet the CIA sections and spy-bits feel untethered and in need of backstory, which I hope to see developed in future films.\n\n# [TL;DR] An Atomic Brew that Still Works\n\nAll in all, Atomic Blonde is a pretty enjoyable movie for anyone hungry for an excellent action film. For fans of well-crafted choregraphy and stunning camera work, definitely peep this bad boi. For fans of style of substance and bountiful eye candy, this one’s for you. For folks that don’t much care for the driving force of plot in their actioners, this’ll definitely be an easy one to give grace to. Here’s hoping that any future sequel or prequel or whatever film that stars Theron’s character once more has her demonstrating a bit more of her psychological competence. Keep the kicks and random-object fight scenes coming, and I’ll still be snagging a ticket to see if the next Blonde picture goes as nuclear as this one.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n**Recommended for fans of this genre?** Yes! Most definitely, this is a strong entry in action. Did you read my praise for how well-constructed the action is? It’s the best part! Go peep this homie. It’s definitely got comparisons to John Wick in many ways.\n\n**Recommended for non-fans of this genre?** Maybe. There is enough of a crispy cool package here that is diverse and beautiful that many can enjoy it, even if they’re not action fans. However, the action is easily the greatest part and the strongest contributor, so if you’re averse to action, give this a pass.\n\n## Semi-arbitrary Score: 8.5/10"

          "markdown": "**I’m a big fan of the noir style of storytelling.**  The dark undertones and gritty characatures have always been appealing to me throughout many mediums.  There’s just something sexy about people acting joyless while swilling hard liquor and chain smoking.  Atomic Blonde captures many of those moments perfectly while dealing out a hefty dose of fighting.  The story itself is not half bad but it does trip over itself a little bit at the end, leaving a pretty satisfying taste of blood, vodka, and cigarette smoke in the air.\n\nAtomic Blonde is an adaptation of The Coldest City, a noir style graphic novel from earlier this decade.![atomic blonde dark room](https://coronadotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/delphine-and-lorraine.jpg)  And as an adaptation it subscribes wholeheartedly to the stylized dark brooding unhappiness that noir is known for. The main characters live off a diet of booze and tobacco while shifting from bars, back rooms and alleyways of 1980s Berlin.  All of which are just a means to keep their toils in check as they come closer to unraveling the mystery of “Satchel” and the secrets kept between world powers.\n\n**This brings us to story.**  On the surface this story starts with the murder of British spy, some stolen top secret information, and the blonde bombshell sent into the fray to fix everything and find out who done it.  The story contains plenty of intrigue, espionage, and thrills to keep things moving along at pretty good pace, and slows down just enough to enjoy the action and steez the movie really wants to convey.  From the very beginning of the stories exposition, things have gone south for the West and there’s a hill of beans between our Protagonists and the answers they seek.\n\nThe plot points contains nothing crazy, pretty standard James Bond antics but what this movie did well was present the plot in a sexy stylized way.  The only real qualm I had with the movie was the very end when some of character's true intentions and motivations are revealed, living a bit of a head scratching feeling.  I think this really came down to Charlize Theron’s character Lorraine Broughton, whose character was very very cold.  It was hard to get a sense of what motivated her at one point as she was just felt like a machine.  And I think for me the right shade of miserable is necessary as a protagonist of a noir thriller.\n\n**The great bits of this movie for me were clearly its style and action.**  I very much enjoyed the fight scenes throughout the film.  The hand to hand combat felt pretty satisfying and the limited gunplay was handled very well.  Even though Charlize’s character was a skinny white girl, I felt her scrappiness really shone through, allowing her smarts and skill to really make up for her reduced stature.  She also gets the shit kicked out of her which feels appropriate.  Several action sequences also featured long extended shots, with the camera remaining close to the protagonist.  These added to the feeling of stylized grit that Atomic Blonde worked hard to portray.\n\nAll in all. This movie was a success.  The colors, music and overall aesthetic gave me all the right noir triggers to keep me excited.  The narrative does an okay job of providing the audience with mystery and intrigue but has a pretty unsatisfying ending featuring a main character that is unrelatable and cold.  Would watch again."

          "author": "e-vaughn",
          "markdown": "# The Lineage of Mr. Nolan\n\nChristopher Nolan has slowly and steadily crept his way up to the mantle of A-list Directors that I find consistently compelling. The moment I processed the entirety of Momento and rewatched it, I had a growing feeling this man possessed a cinematic flair that would be worth noting for years to come. Today, I am staggered by just how undershot my initial praise has been.\n\nBatman Begins, the Prestige, the Dark Knight, the incredibly well crafted Inception, and then Interstellar had Nolan on a hot hot hot streak. When it was announced that Dunkirk was a war movie that relied heavily on practical effects and it was to have one of the highest budgets, it was easy to get excited. When it was lauded during early reviews, it was easy to get excited. When it landed at 94% on Metacritic, with reviews claiming quips like it was along the lines of “a war movie that stands among greats like Saving Private Ryan and the Thin Red Line”, it was easy to get excited. But when I sat there, watching this movie, I was surprised as just how hard it was to get excited.\n\n# More of a Proof of Concept Rather Than a Film\n\nIt’s easy to watch Dunkirk and gawk at the craftsmenship. As a cinephile that appreciates the struggle of film making and will often praise uniqueness (even when it’s uniquely unpleasant), this movie is a safe bet for recommendations. In a way, this feels like a war movie that is unlike any other war movie, or almost any other movie I’ve laid eyes on. It’s much more of an experience or vicarious ride than most movies. Because it is this way, it also has many purposefully missing components that impact connectivity to it as a film and decrease relatability, interest, or investment in what is happening on screen.\n\n![dunkirk beach](http://cdn5.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/07/dunkirk_still_8.jpg)The technical proficiency is phenomenal. The movie is LOUD. It’s bombastic and physically hurts at times. It showcases dizzying cinematography and scope. It has a sense of presentness for the audience because of its framing and intimate proximity with the few character the camera follows. Right out of the gate as we’re shown the only footage in the actual town of Dunkirk, bullets start flying and immediately entranced me in this feeling of claustrophobia, hopelessness, and sheer luck. A squad of about ten min immediately is cut down to a single survivor, and there is no emotional affect apparent from the character we’re left with.\n\nThe other 3 fragmented storylines showcase a familial sea ship (one day’s timeline), a dogfighting aircraft (1 hour timeline), and the aforementioned stranded private on the coast awaiting pickup (approximately one week’s timeline, if I recall correctly). These characters have no backstory and very little personality, save for the seamen’s moral compass. These characters are purposefully removed from humanity in a depiction that lends them to be more like avatars, rather than characters. No backstory. No experiential motivations for their actions. No forward momentum other than saving themselves or someone else’s life.\n\n# Detached Action is Boring Action\n\nThis creates a viewing experience that is inherently detached, for me. As I watched bullets flying and sat gripping on my seat-rest due to the cacophony of war-mess, I found myself never really impressed by the action. I was constantly impressed by the shots and framing and scope, but never the action. These depictions of war feel huge, realistic, and completely not glamorous. There is no glory here on screen. No advocacy that lends our audience to ever want to be near these environments. Even when the heroism in the air causes the soldiers to erupt into applause, it feels like an insignificant moments as these faceless avatars are thrust into the next minute where they must continue to strive towards survival.\n\nAt the end of the relatively meager 106 minute runtime (especially small for a war film), I found myself physically exhausted from the action. It was an ordeal to sit through because it was never-ending noise and unemotional action. Not “poorly crafted”, action, mind you. But unattached action. I found myself yearning to take this intended experience a step further, and watch it in IMAX. Or better yet, snag a pair of VR goggles and experience the whole film in a 1st Person POV from someone’s perspective. Really put me in the action. If that’s the aim, that is.\n\nThere was one compelling thought provoking moment that really surprised me. And this stands as a spoiler. \n\nWhen the young boy on the sea vessel tells Cilian Murphy’s character that his friend will be fine, even when he won’t… I was quite shocked. This was the single rousing moment of surprise in the whole film, and I found the boy’s decision to be one that took more nobility than the majority of sacrificial acts constantly on display. It also required more processing than the entirety of the rest of the movie. I was simultaneous impressed and contemplative.![dunkirk sitting beach](https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/mHOiKUjNOEzftyHNJk3hItZLpzo/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/12/16/794/n/1922283/ddc0efbec1c70c9e_1.gif)\n\nOther than that, the credits rolling gave me a sense of relief. Not because of tension, but because I could now rest. I want to highlight that I am tying this sense of exhaustion as a unusual reaction in my that stems from feeling the characters have no life or audience investment ask of them. I’ve watched countless action films and rarely feel “tired” watching any movie. This reaction makes this movie feel truly unique in this way, for me, and I must say that its uniqueness makes it feel all at once novel, hard to recommend, and also pale in comparison to other War Movies that I might place above it (Saving Private Ryan, We Were Soldiers, Black Hawk Down, Full Metal Jacket, Fury, and even Enemy at the Gates).\n\n# Conclusions and whatnot (TL;DR):\n\nDunkirk is a unique experience. It doesn’t feel cinematic. It feels vicarious and detached. It feels abstract and ungrounded. It feels like a tour of war rather than a character journey. It abstains from compelling dialogue and characters, and embraces claustrophobia and a feeling of hopelessness. It’s not a fun movie to watch. I wouldn’t want to watch it again… I don’t think. But I admire and respect it. I feel it crafts an experience comparable to that of a videogame, yet is decidedly a passive interaction. It doesn’t give me much to chew on because my teeth were clenched a bit too hard throughout. It’s boom boom loud and expendably violent, yet it doesn’t reward us with gore for the gorehounds or style for the fashionistas. It rewards us for enduring… and that’s not exactly a fun experience for a movie. And that’s ok.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n**Recommended for fans of this genre?** Yes. For fans of war movies specifically, this is a unique experience and its beyond well-crafted enough to recommend one endures the runtime. It’s realistic and detached and desensitizing and not beautiful…. And sometimes that’s just the right depiction of war we need in our lives.\n\n**Recommended for non-fans of this genre?** No. I wouldn’t recommend this movie to most folks. I wouldn’t recommend it to action movie fans. I wouldn’t recommend it to non-action fans, or folks that watch movies to get lost in the experience. I wouldn’t recommend this to folks who care more about characters than the visuals. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone looking to mull over the complexities of life or be provoked into brainy discussions. I would recommend this to someone who’s looking for a ride rather than a movie though.\n\n## Semi-arbitrary Score: 6.0/10"

Something for your brain to chew on while the story plays out in front of you.  His batman movies were clearly elevated beyond most other superhero movies, with characters and themes that felt a little more serious and poignant rather than fantastical.  Movies like Inception and Interstellar gave us a fantastical quest but broke them down to showcase the stories themselves, making the characters and their struggles the set pieces for the narrative.\n\n**Dunkirk has done this to the max.**  Everything in this movie is done to showcase the characters in this movie and the primal motivations they have in a very dire situation.![dunkirk beginning](http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/63/77/22/13628578/3/920x920.jpg)The movie starts off with a bit of slow exposition, hammering home that the entire British army is up against a wall and is trying to get home, then all hell breaks loose and the feelings of desperation mixed with fear begin and rarely cease.\n\n*The real character in this movie comes from the atmosphere.*  There is very little dialogue and the only characters that really have names are civilians.  The only thing we really get to know about these characters are their rank and what army they fight for. Everything else you need to know about them builds off of their behaviors as they try to escape their situation.\n\n**And their situation is pretty fucked.**  This movie does a great job at instilling that sentiment.  The story revolves around several groups of people caught up in what seems like a logistics nightmare mixed with the emotions of war.  Everyone is desperately trying to get off this beach and are sometimes acting irrational and deceitful.  Their story is one base emotions and the ones that make a difference are able to put those emotions aside and act dutifully.![dunkirk planes](https://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Dunkirk-Trailer-2-35.jpg)\n\nI think what Dunkirk has done very successfully is build a sense of tension, it’s hard to deny Nolan that.  From the beginning to the end you feel as though there is a horrible and dire situation on this beach, and not only are these characters experiencing the stress from these moments, but you as the audience are as well.  There are really loud and unpleasant noises, unglamourous and subtle action sequences that only let you experience the fervor of war, and long periods of pregnant, silent pensiveness.  You are here to empathize and experience these events, not feel wonderment or an impression of intrigue through exposition and plot.\n\n**But where does Dunkirk fall Short?**  For it’s impressive feats of war portrayal Dunkirk did make me feel uncomfortable at times, but in an engrossing way.  I wasn’t wanting the movie to end but I was looking for some catharsis which is achieved in a very small way when the story's conclusion finally reveals itself.  It was somewhat satisfying, but generally I was felt like there wasn’t much here in terms of face value entertainment.  It is a very special film that makes you respect the act of war and makes you feel connected to it in a way few other war movies have been able to do.  But it’s not a Summer night burner that you want to watch with a bunch of buddies."
